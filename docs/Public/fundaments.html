      <p>The “Basics of Computer Engineering” course is structured to provide a holistic insight into the realm of Computer Engineering, encompassing both scholarly and vocational viewpoints. The curriculum is designed to furnish learners with the rudimentary understanding indispensable in this engineering discipline (including mathematics, physics, anthropology, and ethics), prospective career trajectories, and the responsibilities of a computer engineer in today’s world. The course is divided into two parts. The initial part is concentrated on theoretical underpinnings, while the latter part is committed to the cultivation of practical competencies. The theoretical part comprises three fundamental units of content.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical context: the progression of Computer Engineering from its inception to its current state and potential future developments. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or vocation. The humanistic perspective: the underpinnings of anthropology and ethics.</li>
        <li>Information and Data: Representation of information. Organization of data.</li>
        <li>Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Basic principles, current paradigms, and trends in computer systems and applications.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The second part of the course is dedicated to nurturing practical abilities, initiating web development via the implementation of a project to construct a webpage featuring content pertinent to the course. Beyond equipping learners with the technical prowess intrinsic to a computer engineer, this course also encourages the growth of fundamental soft skills for an engineer, such as collaboration, ethical accountability, and communication competencies (both verbal and written) for the articulation of technical data, thus facilitating the comprehensive growth of the engineer as delineated in the University’s pedagogical blueprint.</p>
