# Web Page Project: Courses in Photography

This is a web page project that I developed for my web design course. The aim of this project is to exhibit my fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS, and to display some photography courses that have piqued my interest.

## Detailed Design Document (DDD)

The DDD of this project is composed of the following sections:

### Primary section (index.html)

This is the landing page of the web page project. It includes a title, a logo, a navigation bar, and a succinct introduction of the website. The title is "Courses in Photography", the logo is a graphic of a camera, and the navigation bar provides links to the other sections of the website. The introduction elucidates the purpose of the website and encourages visitors to delve into the various photography courses on offer.

### Connect section (contact.html)

This is the connect page of the web page project. It comprises a title, a logo, a navigation bar, and a user-friendly form to reach out to me. The title is "Reach Out to Me", the logo is identical to the main section, and the navigation bar mirrors the main section. The form solicits the visitor's name, email, subject, and message. The form lacks any scripting elements that would transmit or store the input content. It is purely for illustrative purposes.

### Network section (net.html)

This is the network page of the web page project. It encompasses a title, a logo, a navigation bar, and a compilation of partner pages. The title is "Affiliate Pages", the logo mirrors the main section, and the navigation bar is identical to the main section. The compilation of partner pages furnishes information (name and link) about other websites that proffer photography courses or related content. The links launch in a new tab and redirect to the respective websites.

### Subject section (topic.html)

This is the subject page of the web page project. It contains a title, a logo, a navigation bar, and an in-depth exposition about photography courses. The title is "Courses in Photography", the logo mirrors the main section, and the navigation bar is identical to the main section. The exposition about photography courses is segmented into three categories: novice, intermediate, and advanced. Each category has a subheading, a description, and a roster of courses. Each course has a title, a duration, a cost, and a link to register. The links launch in a new tab and redirect to the course provider's website.

### About me section (about.html)

This is the about me page of the web page project. It includes a title, a logo, a navigation bar, and a concise description about me. The title is "About Me", the logo mirrors the main section, and the navigation bar is identical to the main section. The description about me is inspired by units 2 and 3 (Module 1) of the web design course. It incorporates my name, my age, my pastimes, my education, my professional experience, my abilities, and my aspirations. It also includes a curriculum vitae, two photographs of myself, and some links to my social media accounts.

### Course section (degree.html)

This is the course page of the web page project. It includes a title, a logo, a navigation bar, and a display of my academic program degree. The title is "My Degree", the logo mirrors the main section, and the navigation bar is identical to the main section. The display of my academic program degree is organized by courses, and includes a detailed page with comprehensive information about the web design course (fundamentals.html). The information about the web design course includes the course title, the course code, the course objectives, the course contents, the course evaluation, and the course resources.
## Problems and Solutions

During the development of the web page project, I faced several hurdles and obstacles that I had to overcome. Here are some instances of them and how I addressed them:

- One challenge was ensuring the web page was responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes and devices. I addressed this challenge by employing **media queries** in CSS, which enabled me to define distinct styles for different screen widths. I also utilized **flexbox** and **grid** layouts to organize the elements in a flexible and responsive manner.
- Another challenge was making the web page accessible and user-friendly for individuals with disabilities or impairments. I addressed this challenge by using **semantic HTML** elements, which convey significant information about the content and structure of the web page. I also used **alt** attributes for images, **labels** for form inputs, and **aria** attributes for accessibility features. I also verified the **contrast ratio** and the **font size** of the text to ensure readability and visibility.
- A third challenge was making the web page visually appealing and engaging for the visitors. I addressed this challenge by using **color schemes**, **fonts**, **images**, and **animations** that aligned with the theme and purpose of the web page. I also used **white space**, **alignment**, and **hierarchy** to create a clear and consistent layout. I also used **icons**, **buttons**, and **hover effects** to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the web page.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, I take pride in the web page project that I developed for my web design course. I believe it exhibits my fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS, and it displays some photography courses that have captured my interest. I gained a wealth of knowledge from this project, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing and developing it.
