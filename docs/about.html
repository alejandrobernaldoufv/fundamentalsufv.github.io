            <p>At Focus our main goal is to teach photography in an enjoyable way tailored to each students needs. We strongly believe that photography is an art that can only be truly learned through hands on experience. That's why our courses are designed to allow students to start practicing with their cameras and devices right, from the beginning. 

              In addition to hands on practice we also prioritize making our courses entertaining and motivating. We incorporate exercises, challenges, games. Provide constructive feedback to keep students engaged and inspired throughout their learning journey.
              
              Furthermore we understand that every student has preferences and requirements when it comes to learning photography. That's why we offer a variety of levels, themes and schedules to cater to needs. Our ultimate aim is for each student to not enjoy their experience, with us but also learn and enhance their photography skills along the way.
